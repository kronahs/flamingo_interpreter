state 0

    (0) S' -> . statement
    (1) statement -> . SET NAME NUMBER
    (2) statement -> . PRINT NAME

    SET             shift and go to state 2
    PRINT           shift and go to state 3

    statement                      shift and go to state 1

state 1

    (0) S' -> statement .



state 2

    (1) statement -> SET . NAME NUMBER

    NAME            shift and go to state 4


state 3

    (2) statement -> PRINT . NAME

    NAME            shift and go to state 5


state 4

    (1) statement -> SET NAME . NUMBER

    NUMBER          shift and go to state 6


state 5

    (2) statement -> PRINT NAME .

    $end            reduce using rule 2 (statement -> PRINT NAME .)


state 6

    (1) statement -> SET NAME NUMBER .

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (statement -> SET NAME NUMBER .)
